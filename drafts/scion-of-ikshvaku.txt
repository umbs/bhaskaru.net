Scion of Ikshvaku by Amish Tripathi: 8/10

This is first book in Ram Chandra Series. Overall, I enjoyed reading it. Amish
Tripathi picked Ramayana mythology as skeletal story to build his fantasy story.
This is brilliant and risky approach, but so far, it has paid off well. Rama
Chandra series is second highest selling series in Indian publishing history.
It's brilliant because the story line is more or less set. It's risky because
taking too much liberty with story line and using modern influence may not be
received well by readers, especially those familiar with Ramayana story line.

Author treads this line carefully.

The good: Book explores side characters in Ramayana and builds stories around
them (Mantara, Kaikeyi and reason for her two boons, Vashishta and Vishwamitra).
This is great approach because these characters are have influential, although,
brief presence in Ramayana storyline. So, building on them will be
*non-controversial*. Author kept the storyline tight. It's a perfect page
turner.

Can be improved: The quality of writing. One of the praises on the cover of the
book goes like: "He's Tolkien of India". The quality of writing (English) can be
much improved. Reading the book felt like a friend speaking to me. It must be
taken up few notches.
