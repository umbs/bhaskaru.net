Vim Modes
=========
Vim is a Modal Text Editor. I only knew and used 4 modes: Normal, Insert,
Command-line* and Visual. For many years, I didn't know how to use Visual mode.
I would tap ESC key as if on a sugar-high to get back to Normal mode.

Vim's documentation says there are 7 BASIC and 7 ADDITIONAL modes that are
variations of BASIC modes. A total of 14 modes in official doc. In this picture
[3] by Darcy Parker, there are 26 modes (yellow blocks). Some people on
Hackernews complained that that picture has left out some modes. [4]

Why do we do this to ourselves?

7 BASIC modes are
    1) Normal (sometimes called Command mode. This is different than
Command-line mode)
    2) Visual
    3) Select
    4) Insert
    5) Command-line
    6) Ex
    7) Terminal-Job (this is only available on Vim 8.0 and higher << TODO)


* As per Vim's documentation, Command and Command-line are different modes.
  Normal mode is also called as Command mode. Command-line mode is when you type
':' in Normal mode. I have seen many experienced users mixing Command and
Command-line modes. Just be aware of this while reading Vim doc.
