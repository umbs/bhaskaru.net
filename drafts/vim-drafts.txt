Vim Modes
=========
Vim is a Modal Text Editor. I only knew or thought I used following modes:
Normal, Insert, Command-line* and Visual. But the help system says there are
SEVEN BASIC modes and SEVEN ADDITIONAL modes that are variations of BASIC modes.

That's a lot of modes for a text editor.

BASIC modes
    1) Normal (sometimes called Command mode. This is different than
Command-line mode)
    2) Visual
    3) Select
    4) Insert
    5) Command-line
    6) Ex 
    7) Terminal-Job (this is only available on Vim 8.0 and higher << TODO)


* I didn't know that Command and Command-line are different modes. Normal mode
  is also called as Command mode. Command-line mode is when you type ':' in
  Normal mode
