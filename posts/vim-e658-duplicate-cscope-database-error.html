<h2>
‘E568: duplicate cscope database not added’
</h2>

<p>
TLDR:
$ vim sample.txt
line   45:
E568: duplicate cscope database not added
Press ENTER or type command to continue
Fix:
Add ‘set nocscopeverbose‘ to .vimrc
</p>

<p>
Detailed:

My primary editor for writing code is Vim (http://www.vim.org/) combined with couple of plugins. The cscope_maps.vim (http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_maps.vim) plugin is immensely helpful in code navigation. However, there is an issue with that plugin, particularly in this part of the code.
40    " add any cscope database in current directory
41    if filereadable("cscope.out")
42        cs add cscope.out
43    " else add the database pointed to by environment variable
44    elseif $CSCOPE_DB != ""
45        cs add $CSCOPE_DB
46    endif
47
48    " show msg when any other cscope db added
49    set cscopeverbose
</p>

<p>
To use that plugin, one has to build cscope database on codebase, details of which are given here (http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_vim_tutorial.html) . Imagine if your codebase is like this:
$ project1/a/b/c
$ project2/x/y/z
You have created a cscope database in the root directory of each project.
Vim has to be configured to recursively look for cscope database up the directory until the root of project1. I think out-of-the-box Vim comes with this support (not sure). If $CSCOPE_DB is defined and points else where (say cscope database within project2), the search gets messed up even further.
Opening a file in Vim would then throw following (or similar looking) errors.
$ vim sample.txt
line   45:
E568: duplicate cscope database not added
Press ENTER or type command to continue
Above error means that Vim is compiled with a cscope module and adding another cscope database (line 45) is akin to opening a second database (duplicate). Vim complains. But it is like a warning. You can check what is the first cscope database added/connected using ‘:cscope show‘ command.
Easiest fix is to suppress the warnings. Change line 49 to ‘set nocscopeverbose‘ or add it in .vimrc file (latter worked for me).
